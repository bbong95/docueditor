# Deliverables Portal Implementation Walkthrough

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the [DeliverablesPortal](file:///c:/dev/docueditor/src/components/DeliverablesPortal.tsx#78-347) as a fully integrated, Studio-native component within the DocuEditor application. The primary goal was to ensure the portal matches the "Tone & Manner" of the main application, renders correctly (fixing a grid collapse bug), and adheres to strict typography and content standards.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. UI Layout & Architecture Fixes
- **Solved Grid Collapse**: Identified and fixed a critical CSS conflict where the global `main-preview` flexbox styles forced the portal's grid into a single vertical column. Reworked the [App.tsx](file:///c:/dev/docueditor/src/App.tsx) container layout (`flex: 1`, `min-width: 0`, `overflow: hidden`) to properly support nested layouts.
- **Inline Style Hardening**: Refactored [DeliverablesPortal.tsx](file:///c:/dev/docueditor/src/components/DeliverablesPortal.tsx) to use robust inline styles for critical grid and flex properties, preventing future regression from global stylesheets.

### 2. Studio "Tone & Manner" Synchronization
- **Visual Consistency**: Applied the signature "Paperlogy" noise texture + gradient background to the portal container.
- **Typography Enforcement**: 
    - Enforced **"Paperlogy" Bold (800)** font for the main header, artifact card titles, and modal headers.
    - Updated the Markdown renderer to apply the same font rules to content headers (H1, H2, H3), ensuring deep visual consistency.
- **Navigation**: Added a "Return to Studio" (스튜디오 돌아가기) button with matched styling (pill shape, border, hover effects) for seamless navigation.

### 3. Localization & Content Standardization
- **Korean Localization**: Translated all UI elements (buttons, labels, status text) to natural Korean.
- **Standardized Artifact Titles**: Updated all 15 artifact titles to match the official project specification (e.g., "요구사항 정의서 (Requirements Definition)").

### 4. Technical Enhancements
- **Restored Architecture Diagrams**: Re-implemented the [RoughDiagram](file:///c:/dev/docueditor/src/components/DeliverablesPortal.tsx#42-77) component to ensure visual artifacts (like System Architecture) render as interactive sketches rather than raw placeholders.
- **Routing Integration**: Hooked into `useEditorStore` for reliable view switching between the Editor and Portal.

## Validation Status
- **Layout**: Verified multi-column grid responsiveness.
- **Fonts**: Confirmed "Paperlogy" font application across all UI layers.
- **Navigation**: Verified entry and exit flows from the Studio.
- **Content**: Validated all 15 document items appear with correct titles and icons.

**Status: COMPLETED**
